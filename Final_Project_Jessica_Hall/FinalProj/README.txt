Final Project

After an uncountable amount of hours, I have successfully completed my final project. After testing it, everything seems to work as 
it should. 

I used only javascript and HTML, no open-source APIs.

How to use:
To draw a new shape, select the desired shape button in the top row then click define. Click and drag the mouse to draw your shape.
To transform shape, click select, then click the shape you want in the canvas. Then click transform, scale, or rotate.
To copy and paste, click select, select which shape you want to copy and then click paste. (After selection is made you can also use 
keyboard shortcuts, ctrl c and ctrl v.
The undo button works intuitively, you may also use ctrl z.
Once you have a canvas you would like to save to JSON file click save JSON. This will download it to your computer. 
To load it back in, click choose file, select the correct file, then click the load button. 
To save to an image, click save image button.

This project allowed me to become very familiar with everything to do with HTML canvas. It made me think about the best way to approach 
various aspects which the rest of the program heavily depended on. Overall, I think this was a fair and educational final assignment.

I have included a screenshot of the interface, an image of the canvas outputted by my program, and a JSON file outputted by the same canvas drawing.
